# A-Lonely-Rogue

A rogue-lite game where you play a rogue who has fallen into a dungeon. Fight all manner of monsters from slimes to skeletons to shades as you traverse the floors of the dungeon to find a way out.
Collect items along the way to increase your damage, speed, or even meet some tiny rogues to assist you in your quest.
Defeat the floor bosses to reveal the floor's trapdoor to move to the next floor.
Defeat the crystal monster and beasts to obtain unique crystal items to assist in various ways.

This was made over 3 months as a solo project and the main reason for this was to learn Godot.

Possible Ideas for the future: 
- new enemies ideas: flying skulls, additional demons
- new bosses: gnome wizard, dwarf warrior
- alt final bosss: hydra
- make bombs open locked doors
